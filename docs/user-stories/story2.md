As a logged-in user, sometimes this app will recommend me movies that I donâ€™t like. I want to be able to like or dislike a movie, so that I can see a different recommendation that is more tailored to the kind of movie I'd like to see.

Description:
If a user doesn't like the movie that the web app recommends, they can like or dislike the recommendation to remove it from the list and have it be replaced with the next best recommended movie. This allows the user to see more films that fits what they want to see.
