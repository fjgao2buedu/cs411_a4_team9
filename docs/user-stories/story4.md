I am a student who sometimes listens to music. I sometimes listen to movies featured in a movie's soundtrack. I would like to find the original movie of the song.    

Description:
Upon connecting to a user's spotify, if a song is in a movie's soundtrack it will make sure to add that movie to the recommended list in addition to the similar genre movies that are recommended. The web app will state if the specific song is featured in the movie, so that a user knows that that song is in the movie.
