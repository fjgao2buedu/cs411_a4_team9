User Story #1
I am always struggling to find a movie that I like. As a logged-in user, I would like to see a list of recommended movies based on my music taste so that I can discover new movies that I might like, so I donâ€™t need to search for new movies for hours.

Description:
User opens web app and inputs their spotify credentials on the log in page. The user inputs their username and password into the assigned boxes and clicks find movies. A list of movies appears recommended based on the music they listen to. Most recommended movie appear first on the list and continue sequentially down the list from most recommended to least recommended. If no movies can be found, a message will appear stating this.
