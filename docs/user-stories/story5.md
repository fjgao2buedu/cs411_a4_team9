As a user, I would like to log in to my spotify, so that I can easily find movie recommendations based on the music I listen to. Immediately connecting to my spotify
would make it much easier to access movie recommendations so that I don't have to input songs individually. I can have personal movie recommondations tailored 
just to me. 

Description:
Upon opening the web app, the user will receive a log in page to input their spotify credentials. This will access their spotify account and allow for the movies to
be recommended to them based on their spotify account. This will personalize movie recommendations and will encompass their listening history to create a more accurate
movie recommendation.
