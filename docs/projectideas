CS411 Team 9 Project Ideas

Idea #1: Our first idea is a web application that recommends movies based on your music taste. It will use the IMDB movie database and api as well as the spotify database and api. A user will log in using google for third party authentication. This can be utilized by people to combine their interests and find new media that relates to what they like. Music interests says a lot about a person and can help someone find a new movie to watch if they are struggling to find something theyâ€™ll actually enjoy instead of scrolling through Netflix for hours on end to try to choose something

Idea #2: Our second idea is a web application that tells you the nearest dunkin donuts then generates a playlist for the length of time to that dunkin donuts of upbeat music or sad music. It will use an api that utilizes a map to find the dunkin and then spotify api/database for the music playlist. It can use google for third party authentication. This will motivate people on their walk or set the mood that they want as they go.
