Our project uses Spotify API and TMDB API along with python, html, postgresql, and flask. Oauth is done by spotify, the database we use is PostgreSQL, and our RESTful interface uses Flask. 
The file app.py contains our backend python code and the muvie.html contains frontend code.
Other project documents can be found in our docs folder.
